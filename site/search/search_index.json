But \"correct\" in this context doesn't mean \"the least possible amount of resources\". It's a delicate interplay of cost vs. performance vs.reliability. In order to run our clusters in the most cost-effective way without compromising either performance or reliability it's vitally inportant to understand the Pod QoS model and the implications of PodDisruptionBudget.

Signal Group 1.Workload Rightsizing Resources 2.Demand-based Downscaling 3.Cluster Bin Packing 4.Cloud Provider Discount Coverage Cloud Discounts These signals help us apply and measure cost optimization for Kubernets clusters. The 3 signals in the resources group apply to all clusters - be it on-prem or on-cloud. The cloud discounts naturally only apply to cloud-based managed clusters, where it is very important to pinpoint the instance types and reservation level of our cluster nodes. Let's explain each signal in a bit more detail. The Resources Group Signal Explanation Workload Rightsizing Refers to our ability to allocate the amount of resources that the workloads actually need and adapt resource requests and limits as application requirements change. Demand based autoscaling Measures the capacity of developers and platform admins to make clusters scale down during off-peak hours. Cluster bin packing Refers to our ability to measure and utilize the CPU and memory of each node in the most effective and reliable way through correct Pod placement. The Cloud Discounts group Signal Explanation Cloud Discount Coverage Refers to leveraging cloud VM instances that offer discounts, such as Spot VMs, as well as the ability of budget owners and FinOps professionals to take advantage of long-term continuous use discounts offered by cloud providers.","title":"The Golden Signals of Kubernetes Cost Optimization"},{"location":"golden-signals/#the-golden-signals","text":"The 4 \"golden signals\" of Kubernetes Cost Optimization as defined in a whitepaper released by Google Cloud in June 2023.
